My website portfolio is what I like to call a sneaker portfolio. I'm a fan of sneakers and I like to collect them. 
I got this idea from a website called "StockX" where you can buy and sell sneakers. They have a feature on their website that 
allows you to track the price of your sneakers like stocks. This feature is aptly named your "sneaker portfolio"; however, my 
website has a different function. I intend to have easily navigable menus where I can share some of my favorites with a 
preview card giving some details about the shoes. I'm sure my website won't be appealing to everyone, but I'll get to have 
some fun making it.
