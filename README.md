My website portfolio in progress is what I like to call a sneaker portfolio. I'm a fan of sneakers and I like to collect them. 
I got this idea from a website called "StockX" where you can buy and sell sneakers. They have a feature on their website that 
allows you to track the price of your sneakers like stocks. This feature is aptly named your "sneaker portfolio"; however, my 
website has a different function. I intend to have easily navigable menus where I can share some of my favorites with a 
preview card giving some details about the shoes. I'm sure my website won't be appealing to everyone, but I'll get to have 
some fun making it. So far, the nav menu works and I have successfully embedded a twitter feed. I still need to go in and add 
the information through the drop-down menu. Also not everything is going to go where it's located now. The twitter feed also 
needs to be resized. I'm content at the moment with how far the website has come after trying a ton of things. For me, 
completing the click-through pages, embedding an image and a twitter feed was a huge success.
