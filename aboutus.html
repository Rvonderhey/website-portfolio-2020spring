            Hello, my name is Ryan Vonderhey.
            I attend the University of Pittsburgh
            and major in Physics. I currently live
            in Pittsburgh while I attend school. One of my many interests
            is sneakers. I like the collectable aspect of
            sneakers, but I also really like fashion concept too.
            Sneakers to me are the most essential part of my style.
            This web page was created
            to compile my favorite shoes
            together in one location with
            a little bit of information about them.
            The idea behind this website is to inspire
            other people to share their interests
            online in a coherent format so others can
            enjoy too. Thanks for browsing! :)
