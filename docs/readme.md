Initially, I thought the website project was going to be way easier. I have had some coding experience before, 
but the project turned out to be a lot of work. I'm not an excellent coder and I'm sure my website can be optimized 
significantly. I enjoyed my time making it though and I learned a ton of new information about the foundation of websites. I 
had a lot of aspirational goals at the start of the project and by the time I was finished, I could only finish a few. The 
website is complete and in working order which I'm pretty happy about. All of the buttons work and are attached to other 
pages. I took the advice of Kat who suggested blowing up the sneaker image on my homepage for a more proffesional look. I 
really wanted to do more with the homepage, like resize the embedded twitter feed but I'm just happy that I got it to work at 
all. This project by far took the most amount of time so far, possibly because of my lack of coding skills but it taught me 
the most out of the projects up to this point. I now have the ability to create a website, which broadens my horizons for 
making a resume. It's tough to look at other people's websites styled perfectly with CSS and Java Script and compare them to 
mine. This is my first website, so I have to let all of that go and just analyze my own website for what it is. For my first 
website project, I don't think the finished project turned out too bad.
